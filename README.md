# GUI v2
The idea with my first website was simple: simulate a bash terminal. 

Later on it became clear that most people in the world don't know how to use a bash terminal, so I decided to make my second website. 
This time, the idea was a little more complicated: find a way to simply, visually represent the same data from my other website, but more intuitively.
I called it the "GUI" version. 

It's about time to make an actual GUI. And I've got some clear inspiration.
